title: Demes graph
description: |
  A ``demes`` model is a graph in which each deme is a vertex, and graph edges
  indicate ancestor/descendant relationships. Additional relationships between
  demes are described using `pulses` for instantaneous migrations, and
  `migrations` for continuous migration over a time interval.

      start_time:
        description: |
          The most ancient time at which the deme exists, in ``time_units``
          before the present.
          The ``start_time`` must correspond with the interval of existence
          for each of the deme's ``ancestors``. I.e. the ``start_time`` must
          be within the half-open interval ``(deme.start_time, deme.end_time]``
          for each deme in ``ancestors``.
          If ``start_time`` is specified, and the deme's first epoch's
          ``start_time`` is also specified, they must have the same value.

          If not specified, the deme's ``start_time`` shall be obtained
          according to the following rules (the first matching rule shall
          be used).

           - If the first epoch's ``start_time`` is specified, its value
             shall be used.
           - If the deme has one ancestor, and the ancestor has an
             ``end_time > 0``, the ancestor's ``end_time`` value shall be
             used.
           - If the deme has no ancestors, the ``start_time`` shall be
             infinitely far into the past. I.e. the ``start_time`` shall
             have the value ``infinity``.

          If the ``start_time`` has not been defined after following the
          rules above, an error shall be raised. E.g. an error shall be
          raised for the following conditions.

           - If the deme has multiple ancestors,
             and neither the deme's ``start_time`` nor the first epoch's
             ``start_time`` is specified.
           - If the deme has one ancestor with an ``end_time == 0``,
             and neither the deme's ``start_time`` nor the first epoch's
             start time is specified.
