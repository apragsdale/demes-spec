# A data model for describing demographic models.

The `demes` specification defines a data model for describing one or
more demes (or populations), how they change over time, and their
relationships to one another. A human-readable `demes` model is written
as a YAML file, which facilitates model sharing, reuse, and interoperability.
A reference implementation for loading `demes` models into python is
available from https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-python
