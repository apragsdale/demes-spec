# A data model for describing demographic models.

The Demes specification defines a data model for describing one or
more demes (or populations), how they change over time, and their
relationships to one another. A human-readable Demes model is written
as a YAML file, which facilitates model sharing, reuse, and interoperability.
A minimal reference implementation for loading Demes models into python is
available in this repository under the `reference_implementation` folder,
but users are recommended to instead use the official pip-installable
package: https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-python
